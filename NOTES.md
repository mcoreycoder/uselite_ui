-have different meta descriptions for pages (keep around 155 characters).   
-one h1 per page with your keyword in it
have some content on your page with keyword & keyword varaints in the content. make sure it is mobile friendly. have good page speed.
-Adding Google Search Console to your site can help you know if you have errors on your site that is causing google to not crawl/index it.
-Build out a sitemap.xml and put it in your robots.txt file.
-make sure url paths are descriptive and not too long(bonus if they include the keyword)

-Google still has a hard time indexing single page apps. If planning on utilizing react look into server side rendering to display a separate page for google to index

*** message had image showing the title and description displayed in the google results
-titles and descriptions are important for seo. It is what is displayed on the Google Search page
